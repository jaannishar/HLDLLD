# ðŸ“¦ Factory Design Pattern - Java Implementation

This project demonstrates the **Factory Design Pattern** by creating different geometric shapes such as Circle, Square, and Rectangle. It encapsulates the creation logic inside a factory class, allowing clients to request shape objects without worrying about their instantiation details.

## ðŸŽ¯ What is the Factory Pattern?

The **Factory Design Pattern** is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. It helps to abstract the instantiation process and promotes loose coupling.

Itâ€™s useful when:
- You want to encapsulate object creation.
- You want to decouple client code from concrete implementations.
- You need to manage and extend object creation easily.

## ðŸ’¡ Real-world Analogy

Think of a **Shape Factory** like a shape-making shop:
- You request a shape by specifying the type (circle, square, rectangle).
- You provide the necessary dimensions (radius, side length, etc.).
- The factory creates and hands you the shape, so you donâ€™t need to know the details of how it was made.
