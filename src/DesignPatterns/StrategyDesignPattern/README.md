# ðŸ’³ Strategy Design Pattern - Java Implementation

This project demonstrates the **Strategy Design Pattern** using a simple payment processing system. The pattern enables dynamic selection of different payment methods like **Credit Card**, **Debit Card**, and **UPI**, making the system flexible and easily extendable.

## ðŸŽ¯ What is the Strategy Pattern?

The **Strategy Design Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable at runtime.

Itâ€™s useful when:
- You want to avoid multiple conditional statements (`if/else` or `switch`).
- You want to choose an algorithm or behavior at runtime.
- You want to follow the Open/Closed Principle â€” open for extension, closed for modification.

## ðŸ’¡ Real-world Analogy

Consider a shopping cart that supports different payment methods:
- The customer may choose to pay via Credit Card, Debit Card, or UPI.
- The system delegates the payment responsibility to the selected payment strategy.
- Each payment method is independent and interchangeable.
